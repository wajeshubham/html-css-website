    <p>Sketching is generally a prescribed part of the studies of art students. This generally includes making sketches
        (croquis) from a live model whose pose changes every few minutes.</p>
    <p>A "sketch" usually implies a quick and loosely drawn work, while related terms such as study, modello and
        "preparatory drawing" usually refer to more finished and careful works to be used as a basis for a final work,
        often in a different medium, but the distinction is imprecise.</p>
    <p>Underdrawing is drawing underneath the final work, which may sometimes still be visible, or can be viewed by
        modern scientific methods such as X-rays.</p>
    <p>

        Most visual artists use, to a greater or lesser degree, the sketch as a method of recording or working out
        ideas.</p>
    <p>The sketchbooks of some individual artists have become very well known, including those of Leonardo da Vinci and
        Edgar Degas which have become art objects in their own right, with many pages showing finished studies as well
        as sketches.</p>
    <p>The term "sketchbook" refers to a book of blank paper on which an artist can draw (or has already drawn)
        sketches.</p>
    <p> The book might be purchased bound or might comprise loose leaves of sketches assembled or bound together.</p>

    <p>Sketching is also used as a form of communication in areas of product design such as industrial design. It can be
        used to communicate design intent and is most widely used in ideation.</p>
    <p>It can be used to map out floor plans of homes.

        The ability to quickly record impressions through sketching has found varied purposes in today's culture.</p>
    <p>Courtroom sketches record scenes and individuals in law courts. Sketches drawn to help authorities find or
        identify wanted people are called composite sketches.</p>
    <p>Street artists in popular tourist areas sketch portraits within minutes </p>
